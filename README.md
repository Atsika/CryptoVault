## Usage

There are 2 ways to use scripts for CryptoVault :
* Define variables at the top of the script
* Enter the values when the script asks for it

> üí° If variables are not defined, the script will automatically request them at runtime.  
> Variables with the same name in the client and server script (in bold below) must have the same value.  
> It is recommended not to modify the variables in the 'CONSTANTS' section.

‚ö†Ô∏è The server script must be run with a user who has the **sudo rights** but is **not root**.  

### Variables

| Name | Description | Example | Script |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------|
| PARTITON | Name of the partition on which the vault will be installed | /dev/sda1 | server |
| SIZE | Vault size in megabyte (MB) | 200 | server |
| VAULT_USER | Name of the new user created especially for vault management | vault | server/client
| SSH_KEY | Name of the SSH keys generated for the VAULT_USER | vault_key | server/client |
SSH_PORT | Port the SSH service should listen on | 7222 | server/client | 7222 | server/client | 7223 | SSH_PORT
| SSH_HOST | Host that hosts the vault | 192.168.1.10 | client |
| SSH_USER | Name of the user who executed the server script | admin | client |

> üí° It is recommended to change the SSH port for security reasons.
